1. Print all the integers from 1 to 255
print = [ 1, 2, 5, 256]
1,2,3,4,5......255
var num = 1
while (num != 255){
    console.log(num);
    num += 1;
}
2. Print all odds integers from 1 to 255
grab number 1
grab number 256
loop through the numbers until it reaches 256
add two the number 1
for (var idx = 1; idx <= 256; idx=idx+2){
    console.log(idx)
}
3. Print integers from 0 to 255, and with each integer print the sum so far
start at 0
sum = 0
end goal is 255
loop until we hit 255
sum = starting index + sum
let i = 0
let sum = 0
for (var start = 0; start <= 256; start++){
    console.log(start);
    sum = start + sum;
    console.log(sum)
}

4. Iterate through a given array, printing each value
array = [2,3,58,19,10]
var index = 0
loop through the array length and 
print the values of the array
for (var index = 0; index <= array.length; index++){
    console.log(array[index])
}

5. Given an array, find and print its largest element
array = [2,3,58,19,10]
largest number = 0
loop through the array
    largest number to the first index or value
    compare the first index and the second index
        if the second index is larger
            largest number is equal to the second index
        else 
            largest number stays the same
    increase the index
    find the largest number in the array
print the largest number variable
print that number
6. Analyze an array's values and print the average
average = 0;
sum = 0
loop through the array
    add sum with the array index
divide sum with the array length
7. Create an array with all the odd integers between 1 and 255 (inclusive)
create an empty array
loop from 1 to 255
    if index is 
8. Square each value in a given array, returning that same array with changed values
