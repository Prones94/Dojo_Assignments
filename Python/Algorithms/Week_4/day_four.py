    Recursive Binary Search
    Input: SORTED array of ints, int value
    Output: bool representing if value is found

    Recursively search to find if the value exists, do not loop over every element.

    Approach:
    Take the middle item and compare it to the given value.
    Based on that comparison, narrow your search to a particular section of the array

    Sum To One Digit
    Implement a function sumToOne(num)​ that,
    given a number, sums that number’s digits
    repeatedly until the sum is only one digit. Return
    that final one digit result.

    Tips:
        to access digits from a number, need to convert it .toString() to access each digit via index
        parseInt(arg) returns arg parsed as an integer, or NaN if it couldn't be converted to an int
        isNaN(arg) used to check if something is NaN
