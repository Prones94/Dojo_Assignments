# Assignment: Functions Intermediate II

## Objectives:
- Practice writing functions and looping over dictionaries
- Achieve a better understanding of how to traverse through a list of dictionary of lists

## Challenges
1. __Update Values in Dictionaries and Lists__
    1. Change the value 10 in x to 15. Once you're done, x should now be [[5,2,3], [15,8,9]]
    2. Change the last_name of the first student from 'Jordan' to 'Bryant'
    3. In the sports_directory, change 'Messi' to 'Andres'
    4. Change the value 20 in z to 30
2. __Iterate Through a List of Dictionaries__
    Create a function `iterateDictionary(some_list)` that, given a list of dictionaries, the function loops through each dictionary in the list and prints each key and the associated value. 
3. __Get Values from a List of Dictionaries__
    Create a function `iterateDictionary2(key_list, some_list)` that, given a list of dictionaries and a key name, the function prints the value stored in that key for each dictionary
4. __Iterate Through a Dictionary with List Values__
    Create a function `printInfo(some_dict)` that given a dictionary whose values are all lists, prints the name of each key along with the size of its list, and then prints the associated values within each key's list
