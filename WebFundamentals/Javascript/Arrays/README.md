# Algorithm Practice - Arrays
Create an algorithm for each of the challenges below. Mkae sure that you run your code to ensure your output is matching the provided expected output.

## Question
1. Using the given array:
    `var testArr = [6,3,5,1,2,4]
2. Print Values and Sum
    1. Print each array value and sum so far
    2. The expected output will be:
    ```javascript
        Num 6, Sum 6
        Num 3, Sum 9
        Num 5, Sum 14
        Num 1, Sum 15
        Num 2, Sum 17
        Num 4, Sum 21
    ```
3. Value * Position
    1. Multiply each value in the array by its array position
    2. The expected output will be:
    `[0,3,10,3,8,20]
